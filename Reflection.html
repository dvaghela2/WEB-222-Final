            <p>1. Explain the concept of Responsive Design. What does the term mean?<br> 
                Responsive design is a method of constructing a website in such a manner that it automatically changes its content and elements to fit the screen size on which it is viewed. 
                It stops graphics from being larger than the screen width and saves mobile users from having to do extra work to understand the material.In place of fixed-width settings,
                responsive design websites employ X and Y coordinates on a grid for layout and mathematical percentages for pictures. Using percentages instead of fixed-width parameters with 
                a grid layout results in a more fluid layout that will adjust to match the size of the display.<br>

            </p>
            <p>2. How does responsive design relate to web technologies?<br>
                 The identical HTML structure is delivered to all devices, however the CSS used differs depending on the screen width and/or orientation. The many CSS rules that are used result
                 in layout adjustments that make the material more accessible without difficulties like as horizontal scrolling, zoom issues, and content being chopped off. The goal is to save 
                 development time by not developing and coding distinct websites for each viewing device.This will make it easier to maintain the code base and add new features over time. 
                 The media queries in CSS 5 are critical for this flexibility. To accommodate each new device that is launched, media query rules may be set. Creating fluid columns and images
                 by combining media queries and flexible grids.

            </p>
            <p>3. What did you learn about building web apps for different devices through your
                research?<br>
                Starting with the mobile layout is the ideal technique to develop a web app layout. It is typically simpler with a single column layout, which is most prevalent for tiny devices 
                such as smartphones. Then, when the screen size increases with each larger device, add queries to adapt the layout. This method will make the code created easier to understand.
                Also, property values should be specified in relative units such as percent or rem to make it easy to alter all of the values at once if necessary. The use of div elements as 
                containers for material like as photos makes it easy to resize them for different screen sizes. Grid or flex may be used to accomplish this versatility.
                </p>
                
            <p>4. Finally, describe your learning experience in the course.<br>
                The ideas were simple to comprehend. I understand that the only way to perfect it to the level of output is to practise it again and over again. Because there are so many alternative
                techniques, the flexibility of JS initially made it rather difficult to get things done exactly. C/C++ languages are significantly different. Without having to bother about external 
                libraries or modules, the built-in techniques are really beneficial.
